# explainability_with_pytorch

The purpose of this repo is to present material which is related to explainability algorithms for image data.

(below are under construction)

Kindly note that at the beginning of each file, in the comments section, a list of sources (theory, code etc) is included.

- heatmaps.py : We compute HiResCAM, DeepLIFT and LIME heatmaps on image pixel and region level.

- morf.py : Class which implements the MoRF tenchnnique for heatmap evaluation and calculates the aopc_score.
